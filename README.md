## Definition of Playing Styles

*   **Park the Bus:** This style prioritizes defensive solidity above all else. Teams employing this tactic typically sit very deep in their own half, minimizing ball possession, and focusing on defending their penalty area. They concede few shots but also struggle to create scoring opportunities. 

*   **Possession-Based:** This style emphasizes controlling the game through high ball possession and intricate passing moves. These teams aim to build up play patiently and create scoring opportunities through positional superiority. 

*   **Balanced Attack:** This style reflects a balanced approach between possession and direct attacking play. Teams prioritize keeping the ball and building up play but also look to transition quickly into attack when opportunities arise.

*   **Counter-AttackL** This style uses a high-octane method to exploit space behind the opponent's defense through quick, direct transitions. Teams employing this tactic typically concede possession but look to hit opponents on the break with pace and direct passes. 

*   **Route One:** This style emphasizes long balls from the goalkeeper or defenders directly towards the attackers. Teams playing this style often have limited possession but may be effective at utilizing a strong aerial presence in the attacking third. 

*   **Set-Piece Oriented:** This style focuses on creating goal-scoring opportunities from set pieces such as free kicks and corners. These teams may not necessarily dominate possession, or play creatively, but look to create chances using set pieces.

*   **Pragmatic Attack:** This style emphasizes a practical approach in attack. Teams playing this style prioritize controlled build-up play and calculated decision-making, focusing on trying to create high-quality chances with the resources they have. 

*   **Route One (Defensive):** This style emphasizes long balls but with a more defensive focus. Teams may utilize long balls to clear their lines quickly and avoid sustained pressure from the opposition.

*   **Dominant Possession:** This style signifies complete control of the game through high ball possession. Teams with this label dominate possession metrics, create numerous scoring opportunities, and concede very few shots, demonstrating a high level of both attacking and defensive control.

*   **Mixed Attack:** This style indicates a team that doesn't exhibit a single dominant attacking strategy. They may display elements of different styles depending on the game situation and opponent.
